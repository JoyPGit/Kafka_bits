    // same as Rest Template
    KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    @GetMapping("/publish/{message}")
    public String publish(@PathVariable ("message") final String msg){
        kafkaTemplate.send(TOPIC, msg);
        return "published successfully";
    }

    kafka uses zookeeper, kafka config
    download kafka binary, open in terminal and run zookeeper command to start a zookeeper instance
    bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

    once server is up, now kafka topic can be created
    bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-kafka-topic --zookeeper localhost:2181 --partitions 3
    --replication-factor 2 --topic

    copy as many server files as many brokers you want
    replication factor can't be larger than no of brokers
